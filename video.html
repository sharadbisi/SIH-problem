            <p class="sectionsubtag ">Any activity to loosen and/or elevate soil with any type of implement, primarily undertaken as preparation for seeding or tree planting, including such operations as pre-establishment weed control
                Examples of estimating the percentage of CEA disturbed:
                Use of deep narrow pointed tynes to break up hard pans prior to planting or seeding. In such a case the area disturbed will be the width x length of the rip lines.
                Use of a mounding plough in preparation for planting seedlings. In such a case the area disturbed will be the combined width of any mounds and/or furrows created by their length.
                Use of multi-disc ploughs in pre-establishment weed control and/or preparation for seeding or planting. In such a case the area disturbed will be the width of the implement x length of the plough lines.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Fenugreek seeds were germinated in the dark for 96 h. Total lipid extracts were prepared and found to decrease on germination. Ultraviolet, visible and infra-red spectra were estimated for the lipids of ungerminated and germinated fenugreek seeds. Free fatty acids (FFA), total chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments increased greatly after germination. On the other hand, triglycerides, phospholipids and unsaponifiable matter decreased. Determination of individual phospholipids showed that phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) constitute about 67% of the total phospholipids of ungerminated seeds. After germination PC and PE decreased whilst phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphoglyceric acid (PG)—degradation products of phospholipids by phospholipases—increased. The fatty acid composition showed that the total unsaturated fatty acids decreased whilst the total saturated fatty acids increased on germination. The fatty acids 18:2 and 18:3 were the most abundant acids in the lipids of the ungerminated seeds and fell after germination from 41·2% to 31·8% and 23·2% to 14.4%, respectively. The minor constituent fatty acids 20:0, 22:0 and 20:1 increased by 3·3-, 3·0- and 7·8-fold, respectively after germination.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">GERMINATION IN  FARMING </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Seeds are amazing. Although they might appear to be tiny lifeless objects, seeds are powerful living things just waiting for the right conditions to do their thing! Each seed contains exactly what it needs and is designed specifically for the job it must do. All seeds have the same mission. To germinate and grow into a plant that will produce more seeds.
             To understand the process, you’ll need know the main parts of a seed and their function.
             All fully developed seeds contain three basic parts, the embryo, endosperm and seed coat. The embryo is the part of the seed that develops into a plant. It contains the embryonic root (radical), embryonic stem (epicotyl and hypocotyl), and one or two seed leaves (cotyledons).
            The endosperm contains the starch or stored energy for the developing embryo. The endosperm is the largest part of the seed and packed around the embryo. The seed coat is the outer layer that protects the seed’s internal structures.
            The first stage of germination, called imbibition, occurs when the seed is exposed to water. The seed absorbs water though its seed coat. As this happens, the seed coat softens.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">IRRIGATION IN  FARMING </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">To irrigate is to water crops by bringing in water from pipes, canals, sprinklers, or other man-made means, rather than relying on rainfall alone. Places that have sparse or seasonal rainfall could not sustain agriculture without irrigation. In areas that have irregular precipitation, irrigation improves crop growth and quality. By allowing farmers to grow crops on a consistent schedule, irrigation also creates more reliable food supplies.
            Ancient civilizations in many parts of the world practiced irrigation. In fact, civilization would probably not be possible without some form of irrigation. The earliest form of irrigation probably involved people carrying buckets of water from wells or rivers to pour on their crops. As better techniques developed, societies in Egypt and China built irrigation canals, dams, dikes, and water storage facilities. Ancient Rome built structures called aqueducts to carry water from snowmelt in the Alps to cities and towns in the valleys below. This water was used for drinking, washing, and irrigation.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big"> HARVESTING IN FARMING</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Preparing of soil: The soil is loosened and leaned before the seeds are planted. Ploughs are used for planting seeds. In the event that the soil contains big lumps, they are broken with the help of a hoe. This process circulates air through the soil so the roots breathe easily. The nutrients and minerals get easily blended in with the soil and come to the top. , the fertility of the soil grows and is fit for plantation.
            Sowing of seeds: the good quality seeds sown in the land. At proper depth and distance. 
             Addition of manure and fertilizers: The soil may not have the right amount of nutrients to efficiently help plant growth. Hence, manures and fertilizers are added to the soil to increase fertility and help plants grow well. Manure is prepared by using decomposing plant and animal matter in compost pits. Fertilizers, on the other hand, are chemicals prepared in factories that contain nutrients for a specific plant. It gives faster results. But it has to be used in limited quantity, otherwise, the soil gets infertile. 
            Irrigation: Crops require water for proper growth. The supply of water to the plants is known as irrigation. Sources of irrigation are Well, rivers, lakes, and tube well The traditional methods of agriculture involve the use of humans and animals. The modern technique of irrigation is the drip system
             Protection of weeds: The unwanted plants that develop alongside the yields are called weeds. These weeds feed on the nutrients given to the crop thus decreasing the supply of nutrients to the crop, in this manner, inhibiting their growth.</p>
