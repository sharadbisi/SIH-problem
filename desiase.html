            <p class="sectionsubtag ">Fungi constitute the largest number of plant pathogens and are responsible for a range of serious plant diseases. Most vegetable diseases are caused by fungi. They damage plants by killing cells and/or causing plant stress. Sources of fungal infections are infected seed, soil, crop debris, nearby crops and weeds. Fungi are spread by wind and water splash, and through the movement of contaminated soil, animals, workers, machinery, tools, seedlings and other plant material. They enter plants through natural openings such as stomata and through wounds caused by pruning, harvesting, hail, insects, other diseases, and mechanical damage.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Plant diseases are a severe threat to the entire production. Therefore, it is essential for farmers to effectively deal with them and check them with the help of timely prevention. Depending on the agricultural area size, this task can be difficult, especially since the list of harmful crop diseases is quite impressive. Modern technologies come to the aid of farmers. EOSDA Crop Monitoring allows you to identify dangerous areas and apply an individual approach to yield treatment, significantly increasing disease control effectiveness.This is the eighth fact sheet in a series of ten designed to provide an overview of key concepts in plant pathology. Plant pathology is the study of plant disease including the reasons why plants get sick and how to control or manage healthy plants.

                A number of genera and species of nematodes are highly damaging to a great range of hosts, including foliage plants, agronomic and vegetable crops, fruit and nut trees, turfgrass, and forest trees. Some of the most damaging nematodes are: Root knot (Meloidogyne spp.); Cyst (Heterodera and Globodera spp.); Root lesion (Pratylenchus spp.); Spiral (Helicotylenchus spp.); Burrowing (Radopholus similis); Bulb and stem (Ditylenchus dipsaci); Reniform (Rotylenchulus reniformis); Dagger (Xiphinema spp.); Bud and leaf (Aphelenchoides spp.); and Pine Wilt Disease (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus).</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Bacterial Crop Diseases</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">This page provides an overview of the bacterial diseases in vegetable crops. The related tools listed at the end of the page provided detailed information about the identification, symptoms, and management of bacterial diseases. It is important to have a plant diagnostics laboratory confirm the pathogen causing any diseases in a crop so that the disease can be appropriately managed.

                Pathogenic bacteria cause many serious diseases of vegetables. They do not penetrate directly into plant tissue but need to enter through wounds or natural plant openings. Wounds can result from damage by insects, other pathogens, and tools during operations such as pruning and picking.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Diseases Caused By Parasitic Plants</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Usually we think of parasites as lower forms of plant life such as bacteria, fungi or nematodes. However, a number of flowering or seed plants are parasites on other plants. Parasitic seed plants vary widely in their dependence on a host. The more independent ones, called half-parasites or hemiparasites, have chlorophyll and roots and can manufacture their own food; but they depend on their host for dissolved minerals and organic substances. Others, such as mistletoe, have chlorophyll but no roots and depend on their host for minerals and water. Some other parasitic seed plants, such as dodder, having neither chlorophyll nor true roots, depend entirely on their host for their existence.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Viral Crop Diseases</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Viral diseases are an important limiting factor in many crop production systems. Because antiviral products are not available, control strategies rely on genetic resistance or hygienic measures to prevent viral diseases, or on eradication of diseased crops to control such diseases. Increasing international travel and trade of plant materials enhances the risk of introducing new viruses and their vectors into production systems. In addition, changing climate conditions can contribute to a successful spread of newly introduced viruses or their vectors and establishment of these organisms in areas that were previously unfavorable. Tomato is economically the most important vegetable crop worldwide and many viruses infecting tomato have been described, while new viral diseases keep emerging. Pepino mosaic virus is a rapidly emerging virus which has established itself as one of the most important viral diseases in tomato production worldwide over recent years. Begomovirus species and other whitefly-transmitted viruses are invading into new areas, and several recently described new viruses such as Tomato torrado virus and new Tospovirus species are rapidly spreading over large geographic areas. In this article, emerging viruses of tomato crops are discussed.</p>
