            <p class="sectionsubtag ">In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate .
                Therefore, the rice growing seasons vary in different parts of the country, depending upon temperature,
                rainfall, soil types, water availability and other climatic conditions. In eastern and southern regions
                of the country, the mean temperature is found favourable for rice cultivation through out the year.
                Hence, two or three crops of rice are grown in a year in eastern and southern states. In northern and
                western parts of the country, where rainfall is high and winter temperature is fairly low, only one crop
                of rice is grown during the month from May to November. There are three seasons for growing rice in
                India viz.- autumn, winter and summer. These three seasons are named according to the season of harvest
                of the crop. Autumn rice is known as pre-kharif rice. The sowing of pre-kharif rice is taken up during
                May to August. However, the time of sowing slightly differs from state to state according to weather
                condition and rainfall pattern. It is harvested in September-October. Autumn rice crop is know as 'Aus'
                in West Bengal, 'Ahu' in Assam, 'Beali' in Orissa, 'Bhadai' in Bihar, 'Virippu' in Kerala and
                'Kuruvai/kar/ Sornavari' in Tamil Nadu. About 7% crop is grown in this season. The varieties grown
                during this season are mostly varieties of short duration ranging from 90 to 110 days.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Wheat</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Wheat is grown on 13 percent of the cropped area of India. Next to rice,
                wheat is the most important food-grain of India and is the staple food of millions of Indians,
                particularly in the northern and north-western parts of the country.
                It is rich in proteins, vitamins and carbohydrates and provides balanced food. India is the fourth
                largest producer of wheat in the world after Russia, the USA and China and accounts for 8.7% of the
                world's total production of wheat.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Gram commonly known as chick pea or Bengal gram is the most important pulse crop of India. It is used for human consumption as well as for feeding to animals. Fresh green leaves are used as vegetable while straw of chickpea is an excellent fodder for cattle. The grains are also used as vegetable. India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Burma and Turkey are main gram growing countries. India ranks first in the world in respect of production and acreage followed by Pakistan. In India, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Punjab are major gram producing states.

                On basis of size, color and shape of seeds, gram is divided into two group 1) Desi or brown gram 2) Kabuli or white gram. Yield potential of kabuli is poor as compared to Desi gram.</p>

                Soybean is cultivated over an area of 11.00 million ha and the production is 11.53 million
                tonnes registering a productivity of 10.45 q/ha (QE 2015-16) under Vertitsol in the rainfed
                ecosystem in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and
                Telangana. There persist wide variations in the productivity ranging from 9.5 q/ha in
                Karnataka and Chhattisgarh to 14.8 q/ha in Telangana, primarily due to farm level
                inefficiencies. Dual problems of moisture stress (drought and excess moisture in Vertisols),
                non-availability of Broad Bed Furrow (BBF) equipment in adequate number, besides biotic
                stresses (stem fly, rust, yellow mosaic virus ,and spodoptera), high seed rate, low SRR,
                improper plant population maintenance are the major factors that limit productivity realization
                as per potentia.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Sunflower is an annual plant, that grows with big, daisylike flower. It is tall and course, has creeping or tuberous roots and large, bristly leaves. Some sunflower varieties grow to over 16 feet in height while the dwarf varieties thrive well in small spaces and containers.
                Most sunflowers are heat and drought tolerant. They also make excellent cut flowers and are loved by the bees and birds. The common giant sunflower is useful as a screen, against the hedge or a wall. The miniature sunflowers are small growing and are useful for cultivation in mixed borders and for cut flowers..</p>
